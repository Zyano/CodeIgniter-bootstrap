What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

*************************
Controller implementation
*************************

The implementation is done by overriding the standard CI_Controller and creating a new method
That should be used for loading views, this method can be accessed when extending MY_Controller
and using $this->View() method.

The view method takes 4 parameters, viewName that is the name of the view you want to render (welcome_message).
The data parameter is simply passed directly to the original $this->load->View() method without any changes
this parameter is passed to all parts of the template.
asString is yet another default parameter from the $this->load->view() and is not changed in anyway
Last parameter indicates whether or not to render the menu portion of the bootstrap implementation.
